excerpt: For all you SublimeText 2 fans out their I put together a new Color Scheme for everyone based on the CodeRunner App's default Color Scheme. Feel free to download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/hanakin/CodeRunner-sublime-theme/archive/master.zip), or install it via Package Install. I expanded upon it to include several other common languages in a typical lamp stack (PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, LESS, MARKDOWN). Hope you all enjoy.
